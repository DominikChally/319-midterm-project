# 319-midterm-project
SE-COMS-319 Spring 2023 Midterm Temperature and Humidity webpage using Raspberry Pi and DHT11 Sensor.

Instructions:
To have Temperature, Humidity and Time update constantly, you have to have sensor.py running on the background with DHT11 hooked up properly. You also have to have this running on a HTTP webserver so the Javascript fetches to the JSON file work correctly.
